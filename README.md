# Hardhat environment

The project uses Hardhat to compile, test and deploy solidity smart contracts.

## Installation

1. To use Hardhat install all dependencies from `package.json` using `npm install`.
2. Create a `dev-keys.json` file with your Alchemy API key:
```
{
  "etherscanAPI": "<your-etherscanAPI-key>",
  "alchemyKeyMainnet": "<your-alchemy-key>",
  "alchemyKeyRopsten": "<your-alchemy-key-ropsten>",
  "alchemyKey": "<your-alchemy-key>",
  "bscscanAPI": "<your-bscscanAPI-key>",
  "fork":"main"
}
```
fork may be "matic","bsc" or "main" (used in [hardhat.config.js]())

## Run

To run use the commands available in [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). You can compile the contracts using `npx hardhat compile` and run tests using `npx hardhat test [test file]`.
